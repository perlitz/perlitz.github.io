description: A list of movies I like
---

This is an ongoing list of no particular order containing some of favorite films, all of the movies in the list are such that I consider either interesting, important of just fun. I have chosen to add Rotten-Tomatoes top-critic score[^1] which I find to be the most informative of the scores. Enjoy the list :)

- [The Square (2017)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/the_square_2017) (77%)  

A Ruben Östlund film about modern art, modern civilization and how they went wrong.

- [FORCE MAJEURE (2015)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/force_majeure_2014) (94%)  

A Ruben Östlund film about an unexpected turn of events.

- [Elle (2016)](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/elle_2016) (85%)  

A Paul Verhoeven film featuring an amazing performance by  Isabelle Huppert about a strong person handeling a weak spot.

- [Things to come](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/things_to_come_2016). (100%)

A Mia Hansen-Løve film featuring Isabelle Huppert about the decision we make in life.

- [There will be blood](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/there_will_be_blood) (94%)

A Paul Thomas Anderson film featuring Daniel Day-Lewis at his best about a miner during the black gold rush. The film is strong and troubling, combined with one of the best soundtracks I heard by Radiohead's Jonny Greenwood, it is a must.

- [SPIDER-MAN: INTO THE SPIDER-VERSE](https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/spider_man_into_the_spider_verse) (95%)

A Bob Persichetti, Peter Ramsey, Rodney Rothman Film (…………….)







[^1]: Rotten Tommatoes top critics score is a score made by averaging over ~30 professional critics from major newspapers, each critic gives a yey or ney, if for example a film gets a score of 80%, it means that 8 out of every 10 top critics would recommend watching the film.
