# Mounting an ExFAT external drive on MAC

based on [this](https://apple.stackexchange.com/a/378257).

If your exfat drive shows up as read-only, then all you need to do is unmount the drive and then use the "mount_exfat" utility to mount the drive. Once you do this, and right click on the drive â†’ "Get Info" will tell that you have custom access to the drive, instead of "read-only". Here are the steps:

1. Open the terminal on your mac.

2. Type `diskutil list` and you will get a listing like this:

   ```
   /dev/disk0 (internal, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                
   *500.3 GB   disk0    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk0s1    2:                 Apple_APFS Container disk1         500.1 GB   disk0s2
   
   /dev/disk1 (synthesized):    #:                       TYPE NAME        SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      APFS Container Scheme -              
   +500.1 GB   disk1
                                Physical Store disk0s2    1:                APFS Volume Untitled - Data         407.2 GB   disk1s1    2:           APFS Volume Preboot                 82.4 MB    disk1s2    3:           APFS Volume Recovery                528.5 MB   disk1s3    4:           APFS Volume VM                      3.2 GB     disk1s4    5:           APFS Volume Untitled                10.7 GB    disk1s5
   
   /dev/disk2 (external, physical):    #:                       TYPE NAME SIZE       IDENTIFIER    0:      GUID_partition_scheme                
   *5.0 TB     disk2    1:                        EFI EFI                     209.7 MB   disk2s1    2:       Microsoft Basic Data Backup Plus             5.0 TB     disk2s2
   ```

3. In the listing above, we notice that `/dev/disk2s2 is our external drive. Unmount the drive by running`sudo umount /dev/disk2s2`.

4. Now create a directory in in /Volumes by running `sudo mkdir -p /Volumes/<name of your volume>`

5. Mount the hard drive to this directory your created by running `sudo mount_exfat /dev/disk2s2 /Volumes/<name of your volume>`.

Once this is done, you should be able to create new folders and write to your drive.
