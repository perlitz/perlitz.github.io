Hey, I'm Yotam!<br> 
I'm currently working as a research scientist at IBM Reaserch working on differnt computational linguistic aspects of natural (and neural) text generation from data. Prior to this, I was an algorithm researcher in SAMSUNG Research working on computer vision and image processing applications such as object detection, tracking and noise reduction mainly using deep-learning methods<br>
Originally from the north of israel, I recived by BS.c in Physics and Congnitic-science from the Hebrew University and my MS.c in Theoretical Physics from the Weizmann Institute of Science under the supervision of Karen Michaeli.
