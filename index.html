  <h1>Hi.</h1>

<p>This is a place for me to write about things which I find interesting.
    I hope that this will become a place for me to arrange, and share my ideas and knowladge making them more accecible to whoever wants to read them and more processed for me having spent the time articulating them. 
    </p>
