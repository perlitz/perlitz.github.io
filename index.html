<h1>About Me</h1>

<p>I am an algorithm developer in the ACV (Automotive Computer Vision) team at Samsung Israel R&D Center (SIRC).</p>

<p>
I completed my M.Sc in Theoretical Physics at the Condensed Matter department at the Weizmann Institute of Science, advised by Dr. Keren Michaeli. My thesis discussed novel spin selective conductivity in hybrids of carbon nanotubes and DNA molecules.   </p>

<p>Prior to this, I obtained a B.Sc in Physics and Cognitive science from the Hebrew University of Jesusalem.</p>

<p> My spare time is spent running, doing yoga, watching great films, hiking the negev, climbing the alps and wandering around in the streets of Tel-Aviv </p>
